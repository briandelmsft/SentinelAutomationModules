# SentinelAutomationModules :owl:
---
This project will build a library of callable Azure Sentinel Automation Modules that can be called from other automation playbooks.  The goal is to simplify automation by moving the complex tasks into these callable modules so they can be performed consistently and with ease from a parent playbook.

Many of the Azure Sentinel playbook templates today take a single action, or evaluate only a single piece of criteria and return it.  This project aims to make it easier to evaluate many pieces of criteria before taking action with your automation.
